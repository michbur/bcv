# About bcv

Methods for choosing the rank of an SVD approximation via cross validation.  The package provides both Gabriel-style "block" holdouts and Wold-style "speckled" holdouts.  It also includes an implementation of the SVDImpute algorithm.  For more information about Bi-cross-validation, see [Owen & Perry's 2009 AoAS article](https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.2062) and [Perry's 2009 PhD thesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3052).
