\description{
Perform Wold- or Gabriel-style cross-validation for determining the
appropriate rank SVD approximation of a matrix.
}
\details{
These functions are for cross-validating the SVD of a matrix.  They assume a
model $X = U D V' + E$ with the terms being signal and noise, and try to
find the best rank to truncate the SVD of \code{x} at for minimizing
prediction error.  Here, prediction error is measured as sum of squares of
residuals between the truncated SVD and the signal part.

For both types of cross-validation, in each replicate we leave out part of
the matrix, fit an SVD approximation to the left-in part, and measure
prediction error on the left-out part.

In Wold-style cross-validation, the holdout set is "speckled", a random set
of elements in the matrix.  The missing elements are predicted using
\code{\link{impute.svd}}.

In Gabriel-style cross-validation, the holdout set is "blocked".  We permute
the rows and columns of the matrix, and leave out the lower-right block.  We
use a modified Schur-complement to predict the held-out block.  In
Gabriel-style, there are \code{krow*kcol} total folds.
}
\note{
Gabriel's version of cross-validation was for leaving out a single
element of the matrix, which corresponds to n-by-p-fold.  Owen and Perry
generalized Gabriel's idea to larger holdouts, showing that 2-by-2-fold
cross-validation often works better.

Wold's original version of cross-validation did not use the EM algorithm to
estimate the SVD.  He recommend using the NIPALS algorithm instead, which
has since faded into obscurity.

Wold-style cross-validation takes a lot more computation than Gabriel-style.
The \code{maxrank}, \code{tol}, and \code{maxiter} have been chosen to give
up some accuracy in the name of expediency.  They may need to be adjusted to
get the best results.

\examples{

  # generate a rank-2 matrix plus noise
  n <- 50; p <- 20; k <- 2
  u <- matrix( rnorm( n*k ), n, k )
  v <- matrix( rnorm( p*k ), p, k )
  e <- matrix( rnorm( n*p ), n, p )
  x <- u \%*\% t(v) + e
  
  # perform 5-fold Wold-style cross-validtion
  (cvw <- cv.svd.wold( x, 5, maxrank=10 ))
  
  # perform (2,2)-fold Gabriel-style cross-validation
  (cvg <- cv.svd.gabriel( x, 2, 2, maxrank=10 ))
