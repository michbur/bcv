Description: 
    Methods for choosing the rank of an SVD approximation via cross
    validation.  The package provides both Gabriel-style "block"
    holdouts and Wold-style "speckled" holdouts.  It also includes an 
    implementation of the SVDImpute algorithm.  For more information about
    Bi-cross-validation, see Owen & Perry's 2009 AoAS article
    (at <arXiv:0908.2062>) and Perry's 2009 PhD thesis
    (at <arXiv:0909.3052>).
